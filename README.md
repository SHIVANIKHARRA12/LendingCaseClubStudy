## General Information
Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:

Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)

Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.

Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 

Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)
 
 We have to work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.

## Conclusions
Key Findings:
Default rate increases as loan amount increases

Default rate increases as funded amount investment increases

Default rate increases as interest rate increases

Higher dti (debt to interest rate) corresponds to higher interest rate

higher funded amount corresponds to higher default risk rate

higer installments corresponds to higher default rate

low annual income corresponds to higher default rate

For the year 2007 Florida had extremely high default rate

For the year 2007 FL had extremely high default rate

Florida has extremely high default rate for low annual income group

There is 6% increase in default rate if we go from higher to lower income group

There is 7% increase in default rate if we go from lower to higher funded amount investment

There is 6% increase in default rate if we go from low to high debt to interest rate

There is 3% increase in default rate if we go from low to high installment

There is 19% increase in default rate if we go from low to high interest rate

There is 6% increase in default rate if we go from higher to lower annual income
